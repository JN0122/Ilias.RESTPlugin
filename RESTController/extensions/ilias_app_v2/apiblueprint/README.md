# Requirements (Optional)

To work properly with api blueprints there are a few tools recommended:

* **Editor Tool** - *Mostly a plugin for a editor to highlight the api blueprint syntax* - <https://apiblueprint.org/tools.html#editors>
* **Renderer** - *A renderer for the api blueprint* - <https://apiblueprint.org/tools.html#renderers>

> We recommend using the [Snowboard](https://github.com/bukalapak/snowboard) renderer. It can also parse and serve the api blueprint.
